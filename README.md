Oracle of Hope: Space Race

Imagine a world beyond the cosmos, except, it's not really a world. You guys are class 2 Interplanetary Civiliations that have lain waste to what was once yours. Your motherland/mothership. So now, due to whats right and whats wrong, you must go out and fend for your own planetary nexus, in order to ensure the survival of your civilizations. 

You begin with a sole mothership, with 100 of your greatest civilization members alive to date. You are their hero, but you must find a way to start civilization and remove the waste that has been lain by your own great filter onto you. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter)

As the saying goes... Rome wasn't built in a day. It is now up to yall to construct the greatest civilization known to us.
