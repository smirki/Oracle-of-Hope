# Oracle of Hope: Space Race
---
Imagine a world beyond the cosmos, except, it's not really a world. You guys are class 2 Interplanetary Civiliations that have lain waste to what was once yours. Your mothership is what now survives of your dying civilization. So now, due to what is right and what is wrong, you must go out and fend for your own planetary nexus, in order to ensure the survival of your greatest.

You begin with a sole mothership, with 100 of your greatest civilization members alive to date. You are their hero, but you must find a way to reignite civilization and remove the waste that has been lain by your civilization's great filter onto you. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter)

  

As the saying goes... Rome wasn't built in a day. It is now up to you to construct the greatest civilization known to the rest of us.

You must control the map, fight enemy civilizations, discover new lands, planets, colonies and master new technologies.

There are 3 ways to win - Perfection, Domination, and Creative, but only one person can win. You just have to gear your civilization to the ideal win you are trying to attain.

## Wining Methods:

*A perfection win* takes place with complete elegance in Trade, Diplomacy, and Firepower, as a perfection win, wins by points. The more battles you do, the more city-states, colonies, and planets you conquer, the more you are able to increase your total score. Once every planet is used up (there are 25), then the score for a perfection win is finalized.

*Domination wins* uses complete deference of all colonies in every nation-state, including all planets of every civ. Note, it is best to play for this win early.

*A creative win,* wins with the fastest use to reaching the most technologically possible civilization - ie. finishing the tech tree the fastest.
